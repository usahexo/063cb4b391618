##### Moderator

A moderator is a user who has been given administrative privileges on the server. They can delete messages, ban users, and perform other actions that regular members cannot. Moderators are generally appointed by the owner or administrator of the server.

##### Owner

The owner is the individual who created the server and has administrative privileges over it. They can add and remove members, change settings, and perform other actions that moderators cannot. Owners typically have some sort of financial stake in the server (e.g., they own the domain name or are paying for its hosting).

##### Administrator

An administrator is a user who has been given additional administrative privileges beyond those of a moderator. They can do everything that moderators can do, as well as change settings and add or remove members from the server. Administrators are typically appointed by the owner of the server.
