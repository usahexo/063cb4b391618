#  Tips and Tricks for Unlocking and Playing the Guildhest Roulette in FFXIV: Brigitte Bardot

The Guildhest Roulette is a fun way to get some extra experience points and Gil, as well as some rare rewards, from the game Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn. The roulette can be accessed by speaking with one of the duty officers in any of the three Grand Companies, and then selecting "Guildhest Roulette." There are five different types of roulette: Solo, Light Party (2-3 players), Party (4-8 players), Raid (10 players), and Alliance (20-24 players).

There are three ways to unlock the Guildhest Roulette:

1) Completing the story quests up to patch 2.55.
2) Completing the Chronicles of a New Era quest "The Scars of Battle." This quest becomes available after completing the main scenario up to patch 2.55.
3) Purchasing the Heavensward expansion.

Once you have unlocked the Guildhest Roulette, you can play it once per day for free. If you want to play it more than once per day, you can purchase additional attempts from one of the duty officers for a small fee of 500 Gil per attempt.

Each time you spin the roulette wheel, you will get a random guildhest. Some guildhests are easier than others, but all of them are worth playing because you can earn experience points and Gil, as well as rare rewards such as minion cards and furnishing plans. The hardest guildhests to win are typically the raid and alliance guildhests, but they also offer the best rewards.

In order to increase your chances of winning a raid or alliance guildhest, it is important to have a high level party or raid group. You should also make sure that everyone in your group is properly equipped with appropriate gear and weapons for the guildhest that you are trying to win. Finally, it is helpful to have a leader who knows what they are doing and can give orders quickly and efficiently during combat.

#  The Best Way to Play the Guildhest Roulette in FFXIV: Brigitte Bardot

In FFXIV there are a few different ways to play the guildhest roulette. Players can queue for a specific guildhest, they can join a party and be placed into a random guildhest, or they can use the Duty Finder to be automatically placed into a random guildhest. The following is an overview of the best way to play the guildhest roulette in FFXIV: Brigitte Bardot.

When using the Duty Finder to play the guildhest roulette, players should always select the "Random Match" option. This will place them into a random guildhest with other players who have also selected the "Random Match" option. queuing for specific guildhests can often lead to long wait times, and being randomly placed into a guildhest is much faster.

Additionally, when queuing for a specific guildhest through the Duty Finder, players should make sure they have at least item level 175 gear. This will ensure they are properly equipped for the challenge and increase their chances of success.

#  What You Need to Know About Unlocking and Playing the Guildhest Roulette in FFXIV: Brigitte Bardot

A little over a year ago, Square Enix released patch 3.5 of Final Fantasy XIV Online which introduced the new alliance raid dungeon, Alexander – The Creator. This massive 12-player dungeon required players to complete a set of four Guildhests (cooperative multiplayer tutorials) in order to access the final sector and face off against the Primal, Alexander.

Fast forward to patch 4.0 – Stormblood, and a new alliance raid dungeon is now available for players who have completed all 4 Guildhests: The Ruby Sea – Finest Hour. This new dungeon can be unlocked by defeating the final boss of The Binding Coil of Bahamut – Turn 4. Like its predecessor, The Ruby Sea – Finest Hour requires completion of all 4 Guildhests before entry is granted.

In addition to the new raid dungeon, Square Enix has also added a new game mode to the Guildhest Roulette called “The Ruby Sea – Finest Hour”. This mode features the same 4 Guildhests as The Ruby Sea – Finest Hour raid dungeon with one important difference: All bosses are tuned to be fought solo (1 player). Completing all 4 Guildhests in this mode will reward players with an achievement and title called “Hero of The Ruby Sea”.

With patch 4.0 just around the corner, many adventurers are wondering if they need to complete all 4 Guildhests in order to unlock The Ruby Sea – Finest Hour raid dungeon or if they can simply queue for it like any other alliance raid. Let’s take a closer look at what you need to know about unlocking and playing the Guildhest Roulette in FFXIV: Brigitte Bardot.

The short answer is that you must complete all 4 Guildhests in order to unlock The Ruby Sea – Finest Hour raid dungeon; however, you do not need to complete them again in order to queue for it like any other alliance raid. Simply put, completing all 4 Guildhests is necessary in order to gain entry into The Ruby Sea – Finest Hour but is not required once you have gained access.
