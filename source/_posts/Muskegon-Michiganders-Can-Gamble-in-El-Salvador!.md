#  Muskegon Michiganders Can Gamble in El Salvador!

If you are a Michigander, you can now legally gamble in El Salvador. And, no, this is not a typo - El Salvador is in Central America, and Michigan is in the United States!

El Salvador has long been known as a popular destination for American tourists who want to get away from the cold winters of their home states. But, up until recently, gambling was not legal in the country. This meant that Michiganders could not enjoy casino gaming when they traveled to El Salvador.

But all that has changed! In February of 2017, the El Salvadorian government passed a bill that legalized casino gaming in the country. This means that Michiganders can now enjoy all of the games offered by El Salvadorian casinos, including blackjack, roulette, and slots.

There are now six casinos open for business in El Salvador: Hollywood Casino Express San Miguel, Princess Casino & Hotel San Miguel, Winthrop Casino & Resort Suchitoto, Hollywood Casino Express Santa Ana, Princess Casino & Hotel Santa Ana, and Winthrop Casino & Resort Soyapango.

So if you're looking for a warm-weather vacation with some gambling action on the side, head on down to El Salvador!
