#  Toronto FC Becomes 1st Canadian Club to Win MLS Cup

Toronto FC became the first Canadian club to win MLS Cup by defeating the Seattle Sounders 2-0 on Saturday night.

This was Toronto’s record seventh appearance in the final and their first title. Jozy Altidore and Victor Vazquez scored the goals for Toronto, who were playing without injured talisman Sebastian Giovinco.

Seattle made it to their second consecutive MLS Cup final, but suffered their second consecutive defeat. The Sounders were unable to take advantage of a red card shown to Toronto defender Justin Morrow in the 34th minute.

“It feels amazing. I can’t put into words how I feel at moment,” said Toronto captain Michael Bradley. “We knew it was going to be a difficult game. We knew they were going to come out with everything they had. The fact that we were able to weather that storm and find moments to score goals is incredible.”

#  Montreal Impact Reach Conference Final in Inaugural Season

In their inaugural Major League Soccer (MLS) season, the Montreal Impact have reached the conference final. They are the first Canadian team to make it this far in MLS. The Impact will face the Seattle Sounders in the two-leg conference final, with the first game being played in Seattle on November 22nd.

The Impact reached the conference final after beating Toronto FC 3-2 on aggregate in the semifinal. In the first leg, which was played in Montreal, the Impact won 2-1. They then took a 1-0 lead into the second leg in Toronto, but ended up losing 2-1. However, they advanced to the conference final because of their away goal.

The Impact have been led by Brazilian midfielder Ignacio Piatti, who has scored 16 goals and registered six assists this season. He is one of four Montreal players who have ties to South America (the others are defenders Ambroise Oyongo and Wandrille Lefèvre and forward Dominic Oduro).

The Seattle Sounders are coming into the conference final as favorites. They finished second in MLS during the regular season with a record of 18-10-6, just two points behind Supporters' Shield winners Los Angeles Galaxy. Forward Clint Dempsey led Seattle during the regular season with 15 goals and 11 assists, while goalkeeper Stefan Frei had a league-high 10 shutouts.

The first leg of the conference final will be played on November 22nd at 8pm EST at CenturyLink Field in Seattle. The second leg will be played on November 30th at 8pm EST at Olympic Stadium in Montreal.

#  Vancouver Whitecaps Finish 3rd in West, 5th Overall

The Vancouver Whitecaps ended their MLS regular season on October 22nd with a 5-1 victory over the Colorado Rapids. This win put them in 3rd place in the Western Conference and 5th place overall. The 'Caps will now prepare for their first playoff game which, depending on the outcome of other games this weekend, will either be against FC Dallas or Sporting Kansas City.

The Whitecaps had an up and down season but managed to clinch a spot in the playoffs with some key wins down the stretch. Their biggest win of the season was undoubtedly their 4-1 trouncing of Seattle Sounders FC in August. Other notable victories include a 2-1 comeback win against Portland Timbers and a 3-0 shutout of Real Salt Lake.

Their biggest disappointment of the season was undoubtedly their early exit from the CONCACAF Champions League. After winning their group, they were upset by eventual runners-up New York Red Bulls in the quarterfinals.

Despite this hiccup, they have still had a successful year by making it to the playoffs. They will now look to make a deep run and bring an MLS Cup back to Vancouver for the first time ever.

#  Edmonton Granted MLS Expansion Team

On Tuesday, September 4, 2018, the city of Edmonton was announced as one of two recipients of an MLS expansion franchise. The new team will be joining the league in 2021 with Austin FC.

This is great news for soccer fans in Edmonton and confirms that the city’s new stadium – scheduled to open in 2020 – will be used for top-level competitive soccer.

The process to grant MLS expansion teams is a rigorous one, so this announcement is significant. Both bids were considered by a panel of experts who judged them on criteria such as market size, stadium feasibility, and financial stability.

It’s exciting to see that the city of Edmonton has been recognized for its potential as a major player in North American soccer. This success is due in large part to the hard work and dedication of people like Tom Fath, owner of FC Edmonton.

Tom Fath has been instrumental in developing the sport in Edmonton and his commitment to both FC Edmonton and the new MLS franchise is admirable. We can all look forward to seeing how both teams progress and compete in the coming years.

#  How to Open an Online Casino in Canada - Major League Soccer

It’s not exactly clear cut on how to open an online casino in Canada, but here are some steps that will help you on your way.

To start off, you need to get a license from one of the governing bodies overseeing gambling in Canada. Once you have this, you need to set up a corporate entity and register it with one of the provinces. You will also need to pay taxes on your profits, so be sure to factor this into your business plans.

The next step is to get acquainted with the software providers who offer their services to Canadian casinos. The best ones offer games in both English and French, so make sure to pick a provider who caters to your needs.

The next step is marketing. This is where you need to set yourself apart from the other online casinos out there. One way to do this is by offering unique bonuses and promotions that are attractive to Canadian players.

Finally, make sure that your website is easy to navigate and that your payment options are secure. Players will want to know that they can trust you with their money, so it’s important that you build up a good reputation.
