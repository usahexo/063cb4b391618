#  How old do you have to be to play casino games in Peru?

There is no definitive answer to this question as the legal age to gamble in Peru can vary depending on which casino you visit. However, the general rule of thumb is that players must be at least 18 years old in order to gamble in a casino in Peru.

There are a few exceptions to this rule, however. For example, some casinos allow people as young as 16 or 17 years old to gamble if they are accompanied by an adult. Furthermore, there are a few casinos in Peru that allow patrons as young as 18 years old to gamble without accompaniment.

It is important to note that any person who is under the legal age to gamble in Peru is prohibited from entering a casino, whether they are accompanying an adult or not. So, even if you are just accompanying someone who is of legal gambling age, you could still be subject to penalties if you are found inside a casino premises.

If you want to be absolutely sure about the legal gambling age at a particular casino in Peru, itâ€™s best to contact the casino directly or visit their website.

#  Are there any casinos in Peru that allow players under 18 years of age?

There is no definitive answer to this question since it largely depends on the specific casino and its policies.
