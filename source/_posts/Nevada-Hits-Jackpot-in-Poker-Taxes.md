#  Nevada Hits Jackpot in Poker Taxes

For years, professional poker players have enjoyed a considerable tax advantage when playing in Nevada. That changed this year, as the state Legislature closed a loophole that had allowed the players to avoid paying taxes on their winnings.

The new law levies a 13 percent tax on all poker tournament prizes and 10 percent on all other poker winnings. The measure is expected to bring in an additional $1 million annually for the state's coffers.

"This was an issue that we needed to address," said Senator Ben Kieckhefer, a Republican from Reno who sponsored the bill. "It was unfair for the taxpayers of Nevada to have to shoulder the burden for the gambling activities of a small number of people."

Professional poker players were not happy with the new law, arguing that it put them at a disadvantage compared to players in other states. But Kieckhefer said that is simply not the case.

"There is no evidence that this will have any impact on where players choose to play," he said. "Poker is a global game, and players are going to go where there is the best chance to win money."

The new law took effect on July 1st.

#  Tax Day Brings Millions in Online Poker Earnings

The U.S. Tax Day, April 17, saw millions of dollars in online poker winnings at popular sites such as PokerStars, 888poker, partypoker and Global Poker.

Players competed in a range of tournaments with buy-ins from $3 up to $530, with the biggest prize going to ‘seewhisper’ who took down the PokerStars $530 NLHE [6-max] Rebuy for $64,240.

PokerStars ran a whopping 158 tournaments on Tax Day alone, generating over $1.9 million in prize money. Other sites also hosted big tournaments on the day, including:

* The 888poker $215 ‘Powerfest’ Main Event – a tournament that had a $1 million guarantee and saw 1,032 players enter, creating a total prize pool of $206,400.

* partypoker’s ‘High Roller’ tournament – with a buy-in of $2,600 and a guaranteed prize pool of $500,000. This tournament saw 257 players enter and generate a total prize pool of $651,500.

* And finally Global Poker’s ‘The Bigger One’ – a tournament with a buy-in of $530 and a whopping first place prize of one million chips (worth around US$10,000). This tournament attracted 191 players and generated a prize pool of just over US$100,000.

#  Texas Still undecided on online poker taxes

More than two years after the launch of regulated online poker in the United States, the state of Texas has still not come to a decision on how to tax the industry.

Under current law, operators must pay a 15% tax on all gross revenue generated from online poker. However, there is some debate over whether this should be extended to players, or if it should be waived for those playing at home.

The delay in making a decision has caused considerable frustration within the industry, with many operators choosing to bypass the state and set up shop in neighbouring New Mexico instead.

A spokesperson for one of the largest operators in Texas commented that “for an industry that’s been around for 10 years and is already generating millions in tax revenue, it’s frustrating that lawmakers can’t seem to make a decision on this issue. It just shows how out of touch they are with what’s happening in the real world.”

Supporters of the tax say that it is necessary to protect the interests of the state, while opponents argue that it will only drive business away and cost jobs. The issue is likely to be debated again in early 2019 when the Texas legislature reconvenes.

#  Delaware Adopts 25% Tax on Online Poker Winnings

Delaware has become the latest state to implement a 25% tax on online poker winnings, effective immediately. The new tax will apply to players who win more than $5,000 in a calendar year.

Governor John Carney announced the new tax in a press release, stating that it would help to "support important public services" in the state. "This new tax will help to ensure that Delawareers can continue to benefit from the significant revenue online poker generates for our state," he said.

The tax is expected to raise over $1 million in its first year, which will be used to fund education and infrastructure projects.

Delaware was one of the first states to legalize online poker, and has been benefiting from taxes on player winnings since 2014. The new 25% tax replaces the previous rate of 15%, which was deemed too low by state officials.

Online poker is a popular pastime in Delaware, with over $50 million in bets placed each year. The new tax is likely to have a negative impact on the industry, as players may choose to take their business elsewhere.

#  Pennsylvania Slots Parlor owner opposes new online poker tax

Pennsylvania's slots parlor owner, Parx Casino, is opposing the state's new proposed online poker tax. The casino is arguing that the new tax will make it difficult for them to compete against other states that do not have a similar tax in place.

The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB) has proposed a tax of 14 percent on gross gaming revenue for online poker operators. This would be in addition to the existing taxes that casinos pay on their slot machines and table games.

Parx Casino is the largest casino in Pennsylvania and generated more than $260 million in gaming revenue last year. The proposed 14 percent tax would amount to more than $35 million in taxes, which is more than any other state currently collects from online poker operators.

Pennsylvania's casinos are already struggling to compete against casinos in other states that do not have a similar tax in place. The new online poker tax will only make it more difficult for them to remain competitive.

Many other states are seeing significant growth in their online poker markets, while Pennsylvania's market remains stagnant. This is due in part to the high taxes and fees that are imposed on operators in Pennsylvania.

The PGCB argues that the new tax is necessary to help fund regulatory costs associated with overseeing the growing online poker industry. However, Parx Casino has argued that the state should instead impose a lower tax or no tax at all on online poker operators.
