#  Rockies extend NL's longest current winning streak to 8 games with a 6-2 victory over the Diamondbacks 

 DENVER — Nolan Arenado homered and DJ LeMahieu had three hits as the Colorado Rockies beat the Arizona Diamondbacks 6-2 on Wednesday night.

The Rockies have now won eight consecutive games, their longest winning streak of the season and best since they also won eight in a row from Aug. 9-16, 2017.

LeMahieu extended his hitting streak to 11 games with a single in the first inning, his third hit in as many at-bats. He then doubled in the fifth inning and tripled in the seventh.

Trevor Story had an RBI triple and Carlos Gonzalez added a run-scoring double for Colorado.

Zack Greinke (5-5) allowed six runs on 10 hits over six innings for Arizona. Eduardo Escobar and Daniel Descalso each drove in a run for the Diamondbacks.

#  Nolan Arenado homers twice as Rockies rout Padres 10-3 

Nolan Arenado hit two homers and drove in five runs, Jon Gray pitched six effective innings and the Colorado Rockies routed the San Diego Padres 10-3 on Friday night.

Gray (7-7) allowed three runs — one earned — and six hits while striking out six and walking one. He had been 0-2 with a 6.39 ERA in his past four starts. The right-hander has won four of his last five starts at Coors Field.

Arenado finished 2 for 4, including a 430-foot home run to center field in the third inning that gave the Rockies a 3-1 lead and added a three-run homer in the eighth inning off Phil Hughes that made it 10-3. It was Arenado's National League-leading 33rd home run of the season.

Trevor Story also homered for Colorado, his 29th.

Wil Myers hit a two-run homer for San Diego.

#  Colorado Rockies: MLB Rookie of the Year favorites after strong start to season 

The Colorado Rockies are off to a hot start this season and sit atop the NL West standings. A big reason for their success has been the play of their young players, including several players who are in their first year in the majors.

Some of the rookies who have stood out for the Rockies include starting pitcher Kyle Freeland, outfielder David Dahl, third baseman Nolan Arenado, and shortstop Trevor Story. Dahl and Story in particular have been huge contributors, with Dahl hitting .317 with 6 home runs and 22 RBIs, and Story hitting .319 with 8 home runs and 23 RBIs.

The Rockies are hoping that their rookies can continue to play well and help them make a run at the playoffs. If they do make it to the postseason, they could be serious contenders for the MLB Rookie of the Year award.

There are several other rookie hitters who have had strong starts to the season, including Yankees outfielder Aaron Judge (.326 avg., 10 HR, 25 RBI) and Twins third baseman Miguel Sano (.330 avg., 10 HR, 28 RBI). However, the favorite for Rookie of the Year honors is still likely to be Dodgers starting pitcher Julio Urias, who is 5-1 with a 2.48 ERA.

#  Wade Davis closes out another Rockies win as Denver nears full bloom in May 

DENVER -- The Colorado Rockies keep finding ways to win, and on Monday night it was Wade Davis again closing things out.

Davis recorded his seventh save of the season in an 8-5 victory over the San Francisco Giants at Coors Field as the Rockies improved to 15-9 on the year. They remain in first place in the NL West despite Monday's loss by the defending World Series champion Los Angeles Dodgers.

"It was a good game," Rockies manager Bud Black said after his team completed a six-game homestand with a 5-1 mark. "Our bullpen did a nice job, especially Wade at the end." 

Things haven't come easy for Davis this year, who entered Monday's game with an ERA of 6.75. But he got some help offensively from Charlie Blackmon and Trevor Story, both of whom hit home runs as part of a four-run third inning that gave the Rockies some breathing room.

Colorado starter German Marquez (3-2) pitched into the sixth inning, allowing four runs on seven hits while striking out six. He also helped himself at the plate, getting two hits including an RBI single in the fifth inning that extended Colorado's lead to 7-4. 

The Giants (10-15) scored twice in the ninth off reliever Seung Hwan Oh before Davis got Evan Longoria to pop out to shortstop for the final out. 

The Rockies now head out on road trip to face divisional rivals Arizona and San Diego.

#  Charlie Blackmon hits for the cycle as Colorado Rockies surge to top of NL West

Charlie Blackmon became the sixth player in Colorado Rockies history to hit for the cycle as his team surged to the top of the NL West division.

The 31-year-old outfielder led off the game with a double and then hit a triple in the second inning. He singled in the fourth inning and then completed the cycle with a home run in the sixth inning.

It was Blackmon's first cycle of his career and it helped propel the Rockies to a 10-5 victory over the San Diego Padres. The win moved Colorado into first place in the NL West, one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers.

"It feels good," Blackmon said after the game. "I'm glad we got the win. That's more important."

The Rockies have now won eight of their last nine games and they appear to be peaking at just the right time. With Blackmon leading the way, they could be poised for a deep postseason run.
