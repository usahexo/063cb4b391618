Toronto FC battled back from a 3-1 deficit in the second half to win MLS Cup in thrilling fashion, scoring two goals in injury time to stun defending champions Seattle Sounders.

Trailing 3-1 with just six minutes left on the clock, Toronto FC pulled one back through substitute Benoit Cheyrou, and then equalized through Jozy Altidore in the 91st minute.

In injury time, substitute Tosaint Ricketts scored the winning goal to send the fans into raptures and give Toronto FC their first ever MLS Cup.

“This is for Canada!” said Ricketts after scoring the decisive goal.

Toronto FC goalkeeper Clint Irwin was named MVP of MLS Cup, making several crucial saves to keep his side in the game.
