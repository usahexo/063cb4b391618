#  Legalized gambling could be a boon to NJ casinos

Nearly a decade ago, when New Jersey lawmakers were anticipating the closure of Atlantic City’s casinos, they legalized gambling in other parts of the state in an effort to keep casino revenue within its borders.

Now that Atlantic City is bouncing back, some lawmakers are looking to do away with that law—a move that could benefit the city’s casinos.

At a hearing on Monday before the state senate budget committee, Senate President Stephen Sweeney said he plans to introduce a bill next week that would allow casinos in North Jersey to offer gambling, including table games and sports betting.

The measure is expected to face strong opposition from casinos in Atlantic City and horse racing tracks around the state. But Sweeney says it’s time for the state’s casino industry to grow.

“I think it is time for us to have a conversation about modernizing our gaming laws in New Jersey,” Sweeney said. “There is no reason why we should be limiting gambling options in North Jersey when we continue to allow it in other states around us.”

Sweeney estimated that allowing gambling at North Jersey casinos could generate an additional $150 million per year in tax revenue for the state.

Atlantic City casinos have been struggling in recent years as competition from casinos in other states has intensified. In 2016, four of the city’s 12 casinos closed, resulting in the loss of thousands of jobs.

But things are starting to turn around. In 2017, casino revenue increased for the first time since 2006 and was up 3 percent last year. With new resorts scheduled to open this year and next, Atlantic City is expected to see further growth.

However, officials say they don’t want the city to become a “dumping ground” for gambling revenue from other parts of the state. They argue that allowing casino gambling at North Jersey venues will siphon business away from Atlantic City and lead to more casino closures there.

John Palmieri, executive director of ChooseNJ, which is tasked with marketing New Jersey as a tourist destination, testified against Sweeney’s proposal on Monday. He said allowing gambling at North Jersey casinos could cost the state up to 20,000 jobs.

#  Gambling addiction: What to do if you or someone you know has a problem

Gambling addiction is a serious problem that can have devastating consequences for the individual and their loved ones. If you or someone you know has a gambling addiction, there are steps you can take to get help.

The first step is to admit that you have a problem and need help. This can be difficult, but it is essential if you want to overcome your addiction.

Next, seek out professional help. There are many programs and therapists who specialize in gambling addiction treatment.

The National Council on Problem Gambling also offers a variety of resources for those affected by gambling addiction.

Finally, be honest with your loved ones about your addiction and ask for their support. Addiction is a difficult thing to deal with, and having the support of loved ones can make the journey easier.

#  eSports bets could soon be legal in the US

Online gambling is a huge industry, and it’s only going to get bigger. eSports games are more popular than ever, and people love betting on the outcomes. So it’s no wonder that many are wondering if eSports bets will soon be legal in the US.

The short answer is yes – but there are some caveats. Let’s take a closer look at the current state of online gambling in America, and what this means for eSports fans.

In 2006, the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA) was passed in the US. This effectively banned online gambling, with a few exceptions. One of these exceptions was for fantasy sports betting, which was eventually legalized in 2016.

This left other types of online gambling – such as betting on eSports matches – in a grey area. Technically, they were not illegal, but they were not officially allowed either. This caused some problems for players and operators alike, as banks were reluctant to process transactions related to online gambling.

However, all this may be about to change. In October 2017, the House of Representatives passed the bill known as HR 6477, also known as the “Sports Gaming Bill”. This bill would legalize most forms of online gambling in the US, including betting on eSports matches.

The bill is currently making its way through the Senate, and it is expected to pass. Once it does, we can expect to see a flurry of activity in the world of eSports betting. Operators will start setting up shop in America, and fans will have a chance to bet on their favourite teams and players.

So what does this mean for you? If you live in America and you enjoy betting on eSports matches, then you’re about to get some good news! Betting on eSports will soon be legal in your country, so you can enjoy all the excitement of this growing industry without any fear of legal consequences.

#  Online gambling firm fined £8m for unfair practices

The UK Gambling Commission has fined the online gambling firm 888 Holdings Ltd. £8m for unfair and deceptive practices. This is the largest penalty ever imposed by the gambling regulator in the UK.

888 Holdings Ltd is a Gibraltar-based company that offers casino games, sports betting, and poker over the internet. The UK Gambling Commission's investigation found that the company had failed to protect its customers from being able to lose money they could not afford to lose, as well as failing to disclose information about its bonuses.

The company has also been ordered to pay back £3m that it had illegally withheld from customers. 888 Holdings Ltd said in a statement that it was "disappointed" with the commission's findings but would be "cooperating fully" with its investigation.

It is the second time in two years that 888 Holdings Ltd has been fined by the UK Gambling Commission. In 2016, it was ordered to pay £7.8m for similar offences.

#  Is online gambling bad for your mental health?

Gambling can be an enjoyable form of recreation for some people, but for others it can become a problem that affects their mental health. There’s no one answer to the question of whether online gambling is bad for your mental health, as the effects will vary from person to person. However, there are some things to watch out for if you’re concerned about your mental wellbeing when gambling online.

Problem gambling can lead to a number of negative mental health outcomes, including anxiety, depression, and even suicidal thoughts. If you find that you’re constantly thinking about gambling, or spending more money than you intended on bets, you may be experiencing signs of a problem. Other warning signs include feeling irritable or restless when you can’t gamble, or feeling guilty or ashamed after gambling.

If you think you may have a problem with gambling, it’s important to seek help from a professional. Counsellors or therapists who specialise in addiction counselling can help you address the root causes of your problem and develop strategies for dealing with temptation. If needed, they can also refer you to support groups or other resources that can help keep you on track.

If online gambling is negatively impacting your mental health, it’s important to take steps to address the issue. Seek professional help if needed, and make sure to set limits on how much money and time you spend gambling. Most importantly, remember that you’re not alone – there are lots of people who can help you get back on track.
