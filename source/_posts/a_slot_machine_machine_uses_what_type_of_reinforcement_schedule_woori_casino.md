# A Slot Machine Uses What Type of Reinforcement Schedule

A slot machine is a popular form of gambling that is found in casinos around the world. The game involves spinning reels with various symbols on them, and players bet on the outcome of the spin. Winning combinations are determined by the pattern of symbols that appear on the reels. The allure of slot machines is the possibility of winning big payouts, which are typically much larger than the amount wagered. But how exactly do slot machines keep players coming back for more? The answer lies in the reinforcement schedule used by the machine.

A reinforcement schedule is a pattern of rewards and punishments that is used to shape behavior. In the case of a slot machine, the reinforcement schedule is based on a variable ratio schedule. This means that the machine provides rewards (winning payouts) after a variable number of responses (pulling the lever or pressing the spin button). 

This variable ratio schedule is important because it is one of the most powerful reinforcement schedules for producing and maintaining behavior. Psychologists have found that behavior that is reinforced on a variable ratio schedule is more resistant to extinction than behavior that is reinforced on a fixed ratio schedule (where rewards are provided after a set number of responses). This means that players who are rewarded on a variable ratio schedule are more likely to keep playing, even if they do not win on every spin.

The use of a variable ratio schedule also explains why players tend to experience near-misses on slot machines. A near-miss occurs when the symbols on the reels come close to forming a winning combination, but do not actually result in a payout. Although a near-miss is technically a loss, it is still a form of reinforcement because it keeps players engaged and hoping for the next win. Near-misses are more likely to occur on a variable ratio schedule than on a fixed ratio schedule because the machine needs to provide occasional rewards to keep players interested.

It is important to note that slot machines are designed to be profitable for the casino over the long term. The odds of winning a big payout are relatively low, and the payout percentage (the amount of money paid out as winnings compared to the amount of money wagered) is always less than 100%. Despite this, many people continue to enjoy playing slot machines because of the excitement and possibility of a big win.

In conclusion, a slot machine uses a variable ratio reinforcement schedule to keep players engaged and hoping for the next win. This schedule provides occasional rewards, such as near-misses, which are more resistant to extinction than behavior that is reinforced on a fixed ratio schedule. While the odds of winning a big payout are low, many people continue to enjoy playing slot machines because of the excitement and possibility of winning big.
