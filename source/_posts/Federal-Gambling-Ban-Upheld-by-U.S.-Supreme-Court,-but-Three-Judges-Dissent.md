#  Federal Gambling Ban Upheld by U.S. Supreme Court, but Three Judges Dissent

On Monday, the United States Supreme Court upheld a lower court’s ruling to uphold the federal gambling ban. The majority of the court voted 6-3 in favor of upholding the ban, but three dissenting judges voiced their opinions that the ban is unconstitutional.

The federal gambling ban, also known as the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA), was passed in 1992 and made it illegal for states to sponsor, operate, advertise, promote, license, or authorize any type of sports betting.

In May of 2018, New Jersey challenged the constitutionality of PASPA in federal court. New Jersey argued that PASPA violated the Tenth Amendment by commandeering state resources to enforce a federal law. In January of this year, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of New Jersey and struck down PASPA as unconstitutional.

The U.S. Department of Justice then appealed that decision to the Supreme Court. In its arguments to uphold PASPA, the DOJ claimed that it was not a commandeering statute and that it didn’t violate the Tenth Amendment because it regulated economic activity instead of compelling states to take action.

The majority opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito disagreed with those arguments and stated that PASPA “violates the anti-commandeering principle [of the Tenth Amendment] by authorizing New Jersey to do what Congress has forbidden it to do: enact and enforce laws regulating sports betting.” Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan all joined Alito’s opinion.

In his dissent, Justice John Roberts argued that PASPA does not violate the Tenth Amendment because it does not compel states to take any affirmative action. Roberts was joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Anthony Kennedy in his dissent.

Justice Anthony Kennedy also wrote a dissent in which he stated that he believes Congress should repeal PASPA and allow states to decide whether they want to legalize sports betting themselves.

#  Federal Gambling Ban Upheld by U.S. Supreme Court, with Justices Scalia, Thomas, and Alito in dissent

On Monday, the United States Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the federal gambling ban, commonly known as the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA), in a 6-3 decision. Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Anthony Kennedy dissented from the majority opinion.

The case, Christie v. National Collegiate Athletic Association, pitted New Jersey against the NCAA and four major professional sports leagues (the NFL, NBA, MLB, and NHL). New Jersey had sought to repeal its state ban on sports betting in order to allow its casinos and racetracks to offer such wagers.

Justice Samuel Alito wrote in his dissent that PASPA violated the Tenth Amendment by compelling states to maintain existing gambling bans or else face discrimination in other areas of law. "PASPA is unconstitutional because it violates the anti-commandeering principle," he wrote. "It prohibits state legislatures from enacting any laws authorizing sports betting, thereby commandeering the legislative process of those states."

Justice Anthony Kennedy also dissented on Tenth Amendment grounds. He argued that PASPA "violates the sovereign authority of states to regulate their internal affairs."

 Chief Justice John Roberts authored the majority opinion for the court. He rejected the argument that PASPA violated the Tenth Amendment, writing that "the Constitution does not forbid Congress from enlisting state law enforcement officials to implement federal policy." He also rejected claims that PASPA amounted to a violation of state sovereignty, arguing that the law did not prevent states from enacting their own gambling laws.

Monday's ruling effectively ends New Jersey's efforts to legalize sports betting. In 2012, a federal district court ruled in favor of the NCAA and professional sports leagues, striking down New Jersey's repeal of its gambling ban. The Third Circuit Court of Appeals later upheld that ruling.

#  U.S. Supreme Court Hands Down Ruling on Federal Gambling Ban: 5-4 Majority in Favor

The United States Supreme Court on Monday delivered a landmark ruling on the legality of federal gambling bans, striking down the law in a 5-4 majority opinion.

 Writing for the majority, Justice Samuel Alito said that the federal law banning most sports betting was unconstitutional. He added that the law violated the Tenth Amendment’s reservation of powers to the states.

“The fundamental problem with [the gambling ban] is that it violates the fundamental principle of federalism enshrined in the Tenth Amendment,” wrote Alito. “Congress may not compel states to enact or enforce a federal regulatory program.”

Justices Clarence Thomas, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor joined Alito in the majority opinion.

Chief Justice John Roberts dissented along with Justices Anthony Kennedy, Elena Kagan and Neil Gorsuch. In his dissent, Roberts argued that the Constitution did not prohibit Congress from passing laws regulating gambling.

Monday’s ruling is a victory for state governments and private companies who have been pushing for expanded legalized gambling in recent years. It is also a blow to the NFL and other professional sports leagues who have lobbied against legalizing sports betting, fearing it would damage the integrity of their games.

#  Federal Gambling Ban Declared Unconstitutional by U.S. Supreme Court

On May 14, 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court declared the federal ban on gambling unconstitutional in a 6-3 ruling. The Court found that the law, which prohibited most states from legalizing gambling, was unconstitutional because it violated the Tenth Amendment’s rights of states to make their own laws.

“The power to license and regulate gambling lies with the States, not with Congress,” wrote Justice Samuel Alito in the majority opinion.

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented, writing that the Tenth Amendment did not protect states from “the negative impact of state-sponsored gambling on interstate commerce.”

The Court’s ruling has paved the way for states to legalize gambling within their borders and will likely result in an expansion of gambling nationwide. Some experts are predicting that this could lead to a $250 billion gambling industry in the United States.

The ruling is a major victory for casino companies such as MGM Resorts International and Caesar’s Entertainment Corporation, which have been lobbying for legalization of gambling across the country. Shares of both companies surged following news of the ruling.

#  High Court Strikes Down Federal Gambling Ban, Splits 5-4

The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that a decades-old federal ban on sports gambling is unconstitutional, opening the door for states to legalize wagering on athletic contests.

In a 5-4 decision, the court said that the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) "violates the anti-commandeering principle" of the 10th Amendment, which prohibits the federal government from forcing states to carry out its laws.

 Writing for the majority, Justice Samuel Alito said that PASPA "unlawfully commandeers the States' legislative powers by compelling them to prohibit their citizens from engaging in otherwise lawful conduct." He was joined by Justices Clarence Thomas, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, and Elena Kagan.

Chief Justice John Roberts dissented, along with Justices Anthony Kennedy, Antonin Scalia, and Sonia Sotomayor.

The ruling is a major victory for New Jersey lawmakers, who have been fighting to repeal PASPA since 2011. In 2012, New Jersey legalized sports betting at its casinos and racetracks, but the NFL and other leagues sued to stop the practice, arguing that it violated PASPA.

The case eventually made its way to the Supreme Court, where oral arguments were heard in December. In March, the court appeared to be divided over the issue, with Kennedy appearing to be the key vote.

Kennedy ultimately sided with the majority on Thursday, concluding that PASPA violates states' rights by preventing them from enacting their own gambling laws. He wrote in his dissent that Congress could have instead regulated sports betting nationwide but chose not to do so.

"The legalization of sports gambling requires an important policy choice," he wrote. "But Congress can make that choice if it wishes."

Thursday's ruling paves the way for other states to legalize sports betting and could lead to a multibillion-dollar industry in gambling revenue. It also represents a major shift in federalism jurisprudence, with the court finding that Congress cannot use its commerce power to compel states into taking action.
